# ebacs
Minimalistic Conference Manager

## Testing

If you want to test ebacs I suggest to check out the `minebacs` branch.

## Dependencies

Currently only `bottle`, `blitzdb` and a working installation of `texlive` or any other LaTeX distro that includes `xelatex`.

## Installation

```
git clone https://www.github.com/cmry/ebacs/
nano /yourdirs/ebacs/static/settings.json
```

Or edit the settings.json with your editor of choice. The important part here is to set the `basedir` to where you cloned `ebacs`. Make sure that the trailing slash is retained there.
